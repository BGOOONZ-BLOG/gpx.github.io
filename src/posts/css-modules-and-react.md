Yesterday I gave my first tech talk at the
[ReactJS Barcelona](www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Barcelona/events/232564030/) meetup.
I have to say that I really enjoyed the experience and I hope Iâ€™ll do it again
in the future.

My talk was about [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) and
how to use them with a [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) application.

You can find the slides
