{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>One of my colleagues asked an interesting question this week. We were experiencing issues with\n<a href=\"https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet\">react-helmet</a> and someone proposed to just write our\ncustom component to do the same.</p>\n<p>The proposed implementation looked something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">function PageTitle(props) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    document.title = `${props.title} — TravelPerk`\n  }, [props.title])\n  return null\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>To be used in this way:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">&#x3C;PageTitle title=\"My page\" />\n</code></pre>\n<p>My proposal was to make a <code>useTitle</code> Hook instead. People didn't like it much but for what I\nthought was a peculiar reason:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I cannot see the benefit, not everything must be a hook now</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is a fair concern. Just because Hooks are the new cool thing it doesn't mean everything\nshould be a Hook.</p>\n<p>But in this case I think a Hook is a better solution than a Component.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Firstly let's see how <code>useTitle</code> could be implemented:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">function useTitle(title) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    document.title = `${title} — TravelPerk`\n  }, [title])\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The implementation is almost identical as the one of <code>PageTitle</code> there are only two differences:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>PagetTitle</code> receives props, <code>useTitle</code> expects one string</li>\n<li><code>PageTitle</code> returns <code>null</code>, <code>useTitle</code> implicitly returns <code>undefined</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, since the two functions are so similar why should you use a hook?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Null Components Should be Hooks"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/something/"}}
