As a developer, all I care about is programming languages,\ndesign patterns, and the new cool JS framework that came out two minutes ago.\nAll this financial jargon has little or no interest to me, right? WRONG!</p>\n<p>The first step in solving a problem is to understand it. Otherwise, you’re just\na monkey coder. You can’t add anything to the project besides writing code that\nsomeone else planned.</p>\n<p>The only way to escape this is to study.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\">\nThe cool thing about our job is that we serve other industries and we learn from them.\n</div>\n<p>I found it quite hard to understand hedge funds since I didn’t have any\nfinancial background. Even\n<a href=\"http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470049278.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Hedge Funds for Dummies</a>\nwas too complicated for me and many resources out there are trying to help you\ninvest in hedge funds rather than simply explain how they work. This document is\nthe guide I needed two years ago and couldn’t find. I hope this can help others,\nmaybe even future <em>Fundbasers</em>.</p>\n<h2>What is an Investment Fund?</h2>\n<p>Before explaining what a hedge fund is, there are some concepts we need to\ncover, starting with: “what a fund is”. The\n<a href=\"https://dictionary.cambridge.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Cambridge Dictionary</a> has a good definition\nfor it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>fund</strong> /fʌnd/</p>\n<p>noun – an amount of money saved, collected, or provided for a particular\npurpose: a pension/trust fund The hospital has set up a special fund to buy\nnew equipment. Contributions are being sought for the disaster fund.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think about the birthday fund you have in the office: money is collected, saved,\nand then spent/provided for the purpose of buying presents for your colleagues.</p>\n<p>If you create a fund with the purpose to be invested in and earn a profit, you\nhave an investment fund. Setting up an investment fund is not as easy as\ncreating a birthday fund; there are laws that regulate how the fund should work\nand often those rules change depending on the country. Generally speaking you\nusually have these components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fund Manager: The person who decides how to invest the fund’s assets. When\npeople invest in a fund they trust that the fund manager will make the right\nchoices to get a return. Therefore, fund managers must have a high level of\neducation and professional credentials.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fund Administrator: Usually a company to whom the fund manager outsources all\nthe administrative tasks such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Calculating the NAV (Net Asset Value)</li>\n<li>Preparing reports for shareholders</li>\n<li>Payment of fund expenses</li>\n<li>Preparation of fund’s prospectus</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The shareholders: Whomever owns at least one share of a fund’s stock.</li>\n<li>A board of directors or trustees: A group of individuals that are elected as,\nor elected to act as, representatives of the stockholders to establish\ncorporate management related policies and to make decisions on major company\nissues. Such issues include the hiring/firing of executives, dividend\npolicies, options policies and executive compensation.</li>\n<li>A “marketing” or “distribution” company to promote and sell shares/units of\nthe fund.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course there’s more than one kind of investment fund. Probably the most\ncommon are mutual funds - let’s quickly see them before we head to hedge funds.</p>\n<h2>Mutual Funds</h2>\n<p>Let’s say that you want to invest some money but your budget is only $100.\nAlso, you’re not very experienced in finance. Developing an investing strategy\nby yourself might be too hard if not impossible. That’s a typical use case for\nmutual funds.</p>\n<p>With a mutual fund, you can invest your\n$100 and have them managed by a professional team that can set up a diversified portfolio. You’re not going to be the only one who invests in the fund; other people like you will invest $100,\n$1000, $10,000 or whatever amount they choose. Then you’ll gain or lose money\nproportionally to the gain or loss of the fund.</p>\n<p>An important note is the fact that shares are usually issued and can be\npurchased or redeemed at any time. Let’s try to clarify this concept. When you\ninvest in a mutual fund — or any other fund — new shares are created and you own\nsome of them. The more money you invest the more shares you can get. Every share\nis a little part of the fund that you own. To get money you can sell those\nshares to someone else or redeem them i.e. return the shares to the fund owner.\nThe money you get back depends on the fund’s NAV.</p>\n<h2>Hedge Funds</h2>\n<p>Finally!</p>\n<p>The idea behind hedge funds is similar to the one for mutual funds: many people\ncollect their money in order to have investors. The main difference is that\nhedge funds are less regulated than normal funds.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\">\nLess regulated doesn’t mean illegal. Any fund, not only hedge funds, that acts illegaly gets shut down.\n</div>\n<p>Thanks to this, hedge funds can adopt unconventional strategies that can lead to\nhigh returns but also to high risks.</p>\n<p>To avoid inexperienced people investing in hedge funds without understanding the\nrisks, the law allows only <em>qualified investors</em> to invest in hedge funds. The\ndefinition of qualified investor depends on each country, but in general it’s an\nindividual with sufficient investing experience or high net worth and income.\nUsually, investors in hedge funds are people with considerable family wealth and\nlarge institutional firms.</p>\n<p>Another difference is how the fund manager gets compensated. For other\ninvestments, the managers get a percentage of the AUM (Assets Under Management),\nusually around the 0.2%. Hedge funds often follow the “2-and-20” model, meaning\nthat the manager keeps 2% of the AUM plus 20% of the profits.</p>\n<p>This is a very high fee but it’s not all: investors can’t withdraw money at\nwill. When they invest in the fund, they also agree not to touch their capital\nfor an agreed upon time period.</p>\n<p>With all those limitations, you might expect hedge funds to perform\nextraordinarily well. The truth is that, on average, they don’t always\n<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/03/100903.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">beat the market</a> —\nespecially if you take into account the manager fee.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you carefully choose and monitor the existing funds you\ncan gain astonishing returns. In case you were asking, that’s exactly what\nFundbase is for.</p>","timeToRead":4,"frontmatter":{"title":"An Introduction to Hedge Funds for Developers","cover":{"file":{"publicURL":"/static/21c9f465d35ad3b41670c6a8638dfa22/cover.jpg"},"author":"Alejandro Escamilla","link":"https://unsplash.com/photos/ABDTiLqDhJA","alt":null}},"fields":{"slug":"/posts/hedge-funds-for-developers/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/hedge-funds-for-developers/"}}}
