If you don't know what it is, Hacktoberfest is an initiative by\nDigitalOcean, GitHub and Twilio. It encourages people to contribute to\nopen-source projects for the whole month of October.</p>\n<p>In our Barcelona chapter, we focused on helping newcomers starting contributing\nfrom day one. We had presentations and hands-on exercises.</p>\n<p>Among all of this, I wrote a short document to help people getting started.\nFollowing is that document adapted for Medium. I hope others will find it\nuseful.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Imagine it's your first day at a new job. Your company has quite a few\ndevelopers already, and they're working on a cool internal project. Everyone\nthere knows you're staring today. They give you your new laptop, hook you up\nwith all the accounts you need, they show you how the coffee machine works and\nthen you can start. You install all the tools, make sure the project is working\non your machine (usually it doesn't) and then they have a task for you.</p>\n<p>They prepared this task just for you because it's your first day. This task will\nhelp you understand the project and start contributing. Usually, it's some\nrefactoring. You start working on it and maybe you finish it in one day, maybe\nit’ll take longer.</p>\n<p>Open source is more or less like starting at a new job only nobody knows that\nyou’re coming and they didn't prepare anything for you. You have to go and\ndecide what to work on.</p>\n<p>This is just to say that it's not easy to get started and if you manage to open\nonly one pull request today consider it a success. But trust us if you keep at\nit it'll get easier and you'll get better.</p>\n<p>Beginnings are hard and everybody has to start somewhere. Don't feel discouraged\nif you've never done any open source before, we've all been beginners. At\n<a href=\"https://firstpr.me/\" target=\"_blank\">firstpr.me</a> you can see what\nwas the first PR for any GitHub user. Maybe you can get some inspiration out of\nit.

Try it out with some of the developers you follow to see how\nthey started.</p>\n<p>If you have no idea how to open a pull request or even what git is no worries.\nWe've all been in your shoes at some point.

One common theme you can\nsee is that most of those are about fixing typos or improving a documentation.\nThat's a great way to start. Coding can take some effort but <em>veryone know how\nto fxi a borken sntence</em>.</p>\n<p>So, here's idea #1 if you want to start contributing:</p>\n<p class=\"highlight\">\n Pick a project you're interested in and start reading its documentation. Did\n you find a typo? Open a PR. Is there a passage that is not clear or could use\n some rewording? Open a PR. Do you think one more example could make the idea\n easier to understand? Open a PR. Does it have a multi-language documentation\n but the one in your mother tongue is missing? Open a&hellip; well you get the idea.\n</p>\n<p>You will not only contribute to the project but at the same time learn a new\ntool by reading its docs. Win-win!</p>\n<p>And please please PLEASE do not think this is a minor task. Documentation is one\nof the most important parts of any project. And I'm not just saying that. Most\nprojects die because of a lack of good documentation. If you help in this area\nthe maintainers will be grateful.</p>\n<h2>Find a Project</h2>\n<p>Ok, writing documentation is great and all but you want to write some code. The\nbest way to start is to pick a tool you already use. Why? Because you know how\nit works and you know what it should and should not do. Do you follow its Github\nrepo? You should, many ideas come out from there. Check open issues and PRs to\nsee if there's something you could help with. What are people saying on\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Stack Overflow</a> about\nit? Are they confused about something? Sometimes a question could lead to\nimproving the documentation or refactoring some part of the code to make it\neasier to work with.</p>\n<p>One piece of advice here.</p>\n<p class=\"highlight\">\nTry to start with small projects with not too many contributors.\n</p>\n<p>A big repo like Angular's will take a long time just to start up and usually,\nwhen a new problem comes up, there's a dozen or so of developers ready to fix\nit. Bottom line: start small.</p>\n<p>Still don't know what to work on?\n<a href=\"https://up-for-grabs.net/#/\" target=\"_blank\">Up For Grabs</a> has a\nlist of projects that are looking for help. Check out if there's something that\ncould be interesting for you. Other great sources are\n<a href=\"https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Afirst-timers-only+is%3Aopen&type=Issues&ref=searchresults\" target=\"_blank\">first-timers-only</a>\nand\n<a href=\"https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners\" target=\"_blank\">awesome-for-beginners</a>.\nThese are all projects that have decided to mark some of their issues for first\ntimers. When you find an issue you want to work on claim it. That means comment\nin the issue page that you're going to work on it. This is to avoid having more\nthan one person fixing the same problem.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>One important thing, no matter what you end up doing. Be nice and be kind.\nBehind every Github user there's a real person. Maintainers have other things to\ndo. They have families, friends, hobbies and often another job. If somebody\ndoesn't reply immediately, or if they just close your PR with an abrupt comment\ndon't take it personally. They probably have other 200 PRs to go through.</p>","timeToRead":5,"frontmatter":{"title":"How to Start with Open Source","cover":{"file":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5007215007215007,"src":"/static/74e8ef581e069ce4a532c8ebdbba73c5/d874f/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/74e8ef581e069ce4a532c8ebdbba73c5/8d4f6/cover.jpg 1040w,\n/static/74e8ef581e069ce4a532c8ebdbba73c5/ae915/cover.jpg 2080w,\n/static/74e8ef581e069ce4a532c8ebdbba73c5/d874f/cover.jpg 3420w","srcWebp":"/static/74e8ef581e069ce4a532c8ebdbba73c5/3c345/cover.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/74e8ef581e069ce4a532c8ebdbba73c5/026d6/cover.webp 1040w,\n/static/74e8ef581e069ce4a532c8ebdbba73c5/ff470/cover.webp 2080w,\n/static/74e8ef581e069ce4a532c8ebdbba73c5/3c345/cover.webp 3420w","sizes":"(max-width: 3420px) 100vw, 3420px"}}},"author":"George Hiles","link":"https://unsplash.com/photos/cKLr1zNnCzg","alt":null,"hide":null}},"fields":{"slug":"/posts/how-to-start-with-open-source/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/how-to-start-with-open-source/"}}}
