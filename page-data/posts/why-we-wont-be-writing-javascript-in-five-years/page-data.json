Many\ndevelopers love to make fun of it, but it's an excellent language if you\nconsider how little designing it took. Most of us can't event finish a sprint in\nten days, let alone implement a programming language.</p>\n<p>Of course, it's far from perfect and through they years it got updated, although\nnot as much as it should have. Luckily TC39, the committee responsible for\nevolving the language, decided to release one new version every year starting\nfrom 2016.</p>\n<p>We already saw the first benefits of this work with ES6. All the new features\n(arrow functions, generators, modules, …) make it almost look like a new\nlanguage.</p>\n<p>Despite all these efforts, JavaScript still falls behind if compared to other\nprogramming languages and will have a very hard time catching up. There's no\nsupport for data types, it's difficult to work with double precision numbers, we\nneed to use libraries like\n<a href=\"https://lodash.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lodash<a> or\n<a href=\"https://momentjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Moment</a> to have a decent\nstandard library. It's functional but pales if compared to other languages like\n<a href=\"https://www.haskell.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Haskell</a> or\n<a href=\"https://elixir-lang.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Elixir</a>.</p>\n<p>The list goes on and on. After all, its initial purpose was to allow creating\nbasic interactive pages far from what we are building today.</p>\n<p>What's making improvements to the language so slow is the fact that JavaScript\nis always retro-compatible. Every new change must not break existing code. There\nare more than one billion websites out there, and all of them must still work\nafter every browser update.</p>\n<p class=\"highlight\">\nWe need a new language. A language that is better suited to help us create the web of tomorrow. The problem is that browsers won't get one anytime soon.\n<p>\n<p>The one language that got closest to being adopted by browsers was Dart. When\nGoogle released it, people were afraid it was part of a secret plan to\nsubstitute JavaScript in Chrome. Needless to say, this never happened.</p>\n<p>Even if all browser vendors decided to switch from JavaScript to a new language,\ndevelopers would still have to support older browsers. In other words, we would\nhave to build two versions of the same application. Remember when we had to\ncreate a mobile version for websites or add specific CSS code for one browser?\nThis would be 1000 times more painful.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>So why am I saying that I won't be coding in JavaScript in 5 years? Rest assured\nit's not because I decided to become a native developer. Nothing against native\ndevelopment but I love the web, and I hope I'll keep creating web applications\nfor many years to come.</p>\n<p>I attended <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jhusain\" target=\"_blank\">Jafar\nHusain</a>’s talk at the last\n<a href=\"https://2016.fullstackfest.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Full Stack Fest</a> in\nBarcelona. His talk was about\n<a href=\"https://2016.fullstackfest.com/speakers/jafar-husain/\" target=\"_blank\">the\nfuture of ES6</a> and, in particular, new ways to handle asynchronous code.</p>\n<p>During the Q/A I asked this question:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">nope.</p>&mdash; Jafar Husain (@jhusain) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jhusain/status/773834257055776768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 8, 2016</a></blockquote>\n\n<p>He also gave a\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/3pKNRgResq0?t=30m47s\" target=\"_blank\">longer\nanswer</a> on stage. He claims we should be happy to use tools like Babel. They\nallow us to use the latest features of JavaScript today without having to wait\nfor browser vendors to implement them.</p>\n<p>He also added that, since we have source maps, we don't even have to deal with\nthe transpiled code anymore.</p>\n<p>In 5 years JavaScript will look very different from what we have now. Still,\nthat code will be transpiled to ES6 or even 5.</p>\n<p class=\"highlight\">\n  And that got me thinking: if I must use a transpiler anyway, why not choosing\n  one that works with a better language? A language built to create rich web applications.\n</p>\n<p>You may argue that since we transpile to JavaScript, this new language could not\nbe too much different and would be bound to JavaScript's internal logic. It\nwould just be some syntactic sugar on top of it. Similar to\n<a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\" target=\"_blank\">TypeScript</a> or\n<a hrerf=\"https://facebook.github.io/jsx/\" target=\"_blank\">JSX</a>.</p>\n<p>Well, I’m happy to tell you that we're already working on a low-level format,\nand it is called\n<a href=\"https://webassembly.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WebAssembly</a>. It's not\nready yet, but when it will be, new languages will flourish. These languages\nwill be compiled and executed by the browser almost as fast as native code. And\nthey won't have to be retro-compatible because developers will compile them, the\nsource code won't be sent to the client.</p>\n<p>Think of what assembly is to C but built for the web.</p>\n<p>So, I don't know which programming language I will be using in 5 years. Elm is\ncurrently the top candidate, and it\n<a href=\"https://elm-lang.org/blog/farewell-to-frp#what-is-next-\" target=\"_blank\">expressed\nintent</a> to support WebAssembly at some point. What I can tell you is that in\nthe future instead of having a new front-end framework every week we’ll have new\nfront-end languages. And that, if you ask me, is a good thing.</p>","timeToRead":4,"frontmatter":{"title":"Why We Won't Be Writing JavaScript in Five Years","cover":{"file":{"publicURL":"/static/a07cbd38a87a106bb2bd5f27e42d4524/cover.jpg","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5007215007215007,"src":"/static/a07cbd38a87a106bb2bd5f27e42d4524/5de81/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a07cbd38a87a106bb2bd5f27e42d4524/8d4f6/cover.jpg 1040w,\n/static/a07cbd38a87a106bb2bd5f27e42d4524/ae915/cover.jpg 2080w,\n/static/a07cbd38a87a106bb2bd5f27e42d4524/5de81/cover.jpg 4160w,\n/static/a07cbd38a87a106bb2bd5f27e42d4524/eab58/cover.jpg 5548w","srcWebp":"/static/a07cbd38a87a106bb2bd5f27e42d4524/772eb/cover.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/a07cbd38a87a106bb2bd5f27e42d4524/026d6/cover.webp 1040w,\n/static/a07cbd38a87a106bb2bd5f27e42d4524/ff470/cover.webp 2080w,\n/static/a07cbd38a87a106bb2bd5f27e42d4524/772eb/cover.webp 4160w,\n/static/a07cbd38a87a106bb2bd5f27e42d4524/eb63d/cover.webp 5548w","sizes":"(max-width: 4160px) 100vw, 4160px"}}},"author":"Thought Catalog","link":"https://unsplash.com/photos/RdmLSJR-tq8","alt":null,"hide":null}},"fields":{"slug":"/posts/why-we-wont-be-writing-javascript-in-five-years/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/why-we-wont-be-writing-javascript-in-five-years/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216"]}
