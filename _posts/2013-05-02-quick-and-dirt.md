A couple of days ago I read this [article](http://www.inc.com/magazine/201305/jason-fried/the-importance-of-quick-and-dirty.html) from [Jason Fried](https://twitter.com/jasonfried) co-founder and president of [37signals](http://37signals.com/).

I regulary follow the compnay blog, [Signal vs. Noise](http://37signals.com/svn/), I find their opinions very interesting and this blog post was not less.

Quoting what Jason says:

<blockquote>
<p>37signals is known for a focus on quality, and we take that reputation very seriously.</p>
<p>It turns out that that's a problem.</p>
<p>You heard me right: An obsessive focus on quality can be a bad thing.</p>
</blockquote>

The reason he says that is because when you want to create a prototype, just to see if your idea is worth something, focusing on quality leads to a longer development. That's certenly something you don't want if your aim is to test your next killer app
