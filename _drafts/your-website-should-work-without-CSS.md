If you're a front-end developer who tries to keep up-to-date like me you've seen <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" target="_blank">Motherfucking Website</a>. If not go check it out now.

The message it tries to express can be summarized in the well known acronym **KISS** or *Keep It Simple Stupid*. Can you make that tool JS-free? Can you use just formatted text and no images? Can you base your business on an interface based on one text input and two buttons? <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Someone did</a>.

Are all those extra functionalities you provide always a good thing? <a href="http://awesomegifs.com/2013/09/remove-to-improve-a-gif-about-good-design" target="_blank">This gif</a> says it all.

As a rule of thumb you can ask yourself *"Would I be able to use the website with CSS disabled?"*.

I have a real life example for a time when this rule would've been useful. Consider this code:

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/EGUseDas/4/embed?html,css,output">Notification component</a>

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/EGUseDas/2/embed?output">Notification component</a>
